# 🖼️ Image Steganography using Edge Detection and AES Encryption

This project implements an **edge detection-based image steganography** technique in Python using Jupyter Notebook.  
It securely hides secret text within a cover image using **AES-256 encryption** and **gradient-based edge detection** to ensure both data confidentiality and image quality.

## 📘 Overview

Steganography is the practice of concealing information inside non-secret media to protect its existence.  
This project enhances traditional **LSB (Least Significant Bit)** steganography by focusing on **edges** in the image — areas where minor pixel changes are less visually noticeable — and by encrypting the hidden data before embedding.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔐 **AES-256 Encryption** of secret text before embedding  
- 🧠 **Gradient-based edge detection** to identify suitable embedding regions  
- 🎨 **High-quality stego image** with minimal perceptual distortion  
- 💬 **Robust retrieval and decryption** process for extracting hidden text  
- 💻 Implemented entirely in **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**

## 🧩 Methodology

1. **Edge Detection:**  
   The gradient method is applied to identify strong edges in the cover image.

2. **Encryption:**  
   The secret text is encrypted using **AES-256**, ensuring that even if extracted, it remains unreadable.

3. **Embedding:**  
   The encrypted binary stream is embedded in the **least significant bits (LSBs)** of detected edge pixels, allowing more bits to be hidden without affecting image quality.

4. **Extraction & Decryption:**  
   The stego image is processed to extract the hidden binary data, which is then decrypted using the same 256-bit key to retrieve the original message.

## 🖼️ Example Output

| Original Image | Stego Image (After Embedding Secret Text) |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ![Original Image](cover_image.png) | ![Stego Image](stego_image.png) |

The visual difference between the two images is nearly imperceptible,  
demonstrating that the secret data is hidden securely within the cover image  
without noticeable degradation in image quality.
